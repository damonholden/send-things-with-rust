# send-things-with-rust

This project duals as a leaning project for me to better understand the Rust
programming language and as a way for me to do peer-to-peer file transfers
without relying on other services.

## Sources

This project was initially created following the guide in the book for
building a single-threaded web server in Rust. [The book can be found
here.](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch20-01-single-threaded.html)
